title: "How imperfect detection shapes community change estimates across datasets"
---

1. assessed how accounting for imperfect detection influenced estimates of community change by comparing observed and modeled estimates of dissimilarity  

2. first creating observed dataset based on multiple sampling events per year  

3. then created an observed dataset based on one sampling event per year  

4. examined differences between observed datasets by using Bayesian hierarchical regression with change as response and data derivation crossed with dataset as predictor  

5. post-hoc pairwise tests to determine direction and magnitude of differences
