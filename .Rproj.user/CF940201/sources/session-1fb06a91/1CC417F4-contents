## Part 1: description

1. Multi-species abundance/occupancy modelling (MSAM or MSOM): observational dat with detection covariates to estimate "true" abundance or occupancy  

2. Computer beta diversity given species abundance or occupancy (Bray-Curtis for abundance, species turnover for presence-absence)  

3. Regression model using posterior estimates to examine effects of environmental variables on community change through time (allowing environmental variables to have lagged effects)
