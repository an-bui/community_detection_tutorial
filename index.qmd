# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Description

This is a modeling tutorial for the supplement for Miller-ter Kuile et al. "Accounting for imperfect detection to reveal the importance of current and past environmental conditions for community stability". *in revision*

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a detailed description of the modeling approaches used in the paper along with examples of the models in action on both simulated and real datasets.

## Tools you'll need

All models are Bayesian models run in R and JAGS. You will need these programs to run these models.

## Model description

We employed a two-step modeling process (Figure 1).

### A) Multi-species model accounting for imperfect detection

This model links observed abundance or presence-absence of species in a community to detection probabilities to generate a latent "true" abundance or occupancy for each species in each site in each year. We used this model to then generate metrics of community change (beta diversity). We built these models based on previous model developments for accounting for imperfect detection in community datasets [@dorazio2006].

### B) Regression model with environmental covariates

This model incorporates mean and variance of community change metrics from the model in A) into a regression examining the effects of environmental covariates on community change. This model employs a stochastic antecedent modeling (SAM) framework [@ogle2015] to allow environmental covariates to have immediate and lagged responses.

## Outline

In the following pages, we will walk you through the model formulation as well as model code demonstrating the modeling framework.

1.  **Accounting for imperfect detection** walks through accounting for imperfect detection in a multi-species model
2.  **Computing indices of community stability** illustrates how latent values from the models for imperfect detection can be used to calculate multiple indices of community stability (beta diversity)
3.  **Evaluating community stability in relation to environmental variables** shows how to take these derived values of community change and uncertainty around them and use them in a regression that allows covariates to have immediate and lagged effects on community change
